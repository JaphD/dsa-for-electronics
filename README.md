# DSA for Electronics ðŸš€

This repository tracks my progress through a Udemy Data Structures and Algorithms course. As an electronics engineering student, I'm learning DSA to improve my thinking in embedded systems, firmware development, and low-level problem-solving.

## ðŸ§  Why I'm Learning DSA

Understanding how data is structured, accessed, and manipulated helps me:
- Write efficient firmware for microcontrollers
- Handle memory-limited environments smartly
- Develop reliable systems using C and embedded Python
- Build a strong foundation for real-time and signal-processing applications
